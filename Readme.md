# Coding Ninja DSA in JAVA

DSA is the foundation of efficient programming. It delves into:

Data Structures: Techniques for organizing data in a computer's memory to facilitate efficient access, manipulation, and storage. Common examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
Algorithms: Step-by-step procedures for solving computational problems. Algorithms focus on correctness, efficiency (time and space complexity), and readability.
